Patient: Oh, no. Is that bad? 
Doctor: It's treatable. It seems like it's happening because your acne is flaring up. 
Patient: Oh, really. Is it because I stopped my medication for the last three days? 
Doctor: I forgot what I prescribed you. Let me take a look at my notes. Oh, I see. I prescribed you five hundred milligrams of Amoxicillin to take twice a day and a point one Tazorac cream. Have those been working? 
Patient: Yeah, they have. I noticed my face started to get better. 
Doctor: Continue to take those and try not to stop it. Have you been trying anything else? 
Patient: I actually started going to Healing Waters to get photofacials. 
Doctor: I see. Has that been helpful? 
Patient: Yeah, it has, but I want a faster treatment. I'm only forty nine and want to look younger. Are there any procedures or skin care products that can be used to help my face look better?

Doctor: What brings you into see me today? 
Patient: I have had this weakness in my right leg for quite some time now.
Doctor: How long has this been going on and do you know how you injured yourself?
Patient: I think that it was about six months ago that the weakness in my leg started. I don't really remember how it happened. 
Doctor: Can you tell me what you do remember? 
Patient: I was reaching to get something from a cabinet, and I noticed that I was unable to stand on my right toe. Ever since then I have had difficulty pushing off when walking.  My toes were tingling and numb.
Doctor: Was the numbness and tingling mild, moderate, or severe? 
Patient: It was a mild feeling, but this has been an ongoing problem that has been the same since the weakness started. 
Doctor: Have you had any other pain any where else in your body? 
Patient: I have had back pain, but this has been going on for many years and has not changed.  
Doctor: Is the back pain been mild, moderate, or severe? 
Patient: I would say mild. I have also been having cramping in both calves. 
Doctor: How long has that been going on? 
Patient: For the past year but it stopped about two months ago.  
Doctor: Have you had any weakness in the left leg? 
Patient: No. I don't think so. 
Doctor: Have you had any pain around right leg and the area of numbness and tingling? 
Patient: No. Everything that is going on with my right leg has pretty much been the same since it started six months ago. I have not gotten worse or better. 
Doctor: Have you had any bowel or bladder incontinence? Any radicular pain?
Patient: No.
Doctor: When did you first see a doctor for the issue? I remember that you told me you saw a different provider prior to coming to see me.
Patient:  I saw the other doctor in October. That was a couple of months before I came to see you. 
Doctor: I see in your chart that we did a CT scan that shows degenerative changes, but nothing obviously abnormal. Remind me why we did not do a MRI of your spine? 
Patient: I cannot have an MRI because of my ear implant.  
Doctor: That is unfortunate. It looks like we were able to do an EMG and nerve conduction studies. What medications are you taking currently? 
Patient: I had an elevated CK before I started taking stat medications.
Doctor: What medications are those? 
Patient: I am not taking Lipitor anymore. I think I took it for about fifteen months. 
Doctor: Do you know what your levels of your CK were before you started taking medication? 
Patient: I thought that my CK was in the five hundred or six hundreds prior to starting it. Once I started it, my levels increased to about eight hundred and then came down to about five hundred again when it was stopped. I recently stopped taking Lipitor because my levels were up to the thousand's and then my CK apparently has returned to about the five hundreds or six hundreds.  
Doctor: I don't see any labs in your chart. Did your primary do labs for your CK levels? 
Patient: Yes, he did. 
Doctor: Okay. Have you started any other medications?

He was unable to stand on his right toe. Since that time he has had difficulty pushing off his right toe. He has had numbness and tingling of his toes. This has been an ongoing problem. He has had back pain for many years and it does not seem to be getting any better. He has had cramping in both calves for a year but stopped about two months ago. He has no bowel or bladder incontinence. He saw a different provider in October. We did a CT scan that shows degenerative changes, but nothing clearly abnormal. We did not do an MRI of his spine because of his ear implant. We did EMG and nerve conduction studies. He had an elevated CK prior to starting stat medications. He is not taking Lipitor anymore. He thought his CK was in the 500s or 600s prior to starting the medication. His levels increased to about 800 and then came down to about 500 again when he stopped taking the medication. He recently stopped taking Lipitor because his levels were up to the thousands and then his CK apparently has returned to about the 500s or 600s. We did not see any labs in his chart. He just started Zetia. He has not had any weakness or pain since starting Zetia."

Patient: I'm doing good. Thank you. How about you? 
Doctor: Yeah, same old, same old. 
Doctor: So, looks like we're here to discuss your diet. Is that right? 
Patient: Yep. That's right. 
Doctor: Okay, let me look through your chart. It looks like you have high lipid levels, high blood pressure and a possibility for a metabolic syndrome. 
Patient: That looks like my chart. I'm kind of struggling here and I need your help. 
Doctor: Yeah, tell me did you follow the meal plan that we gave to you? 
Patient: I tried for many weeks to follow that meal plan that you gave me. 
Doctor: Okay, did it help? 
Patient: I don't know. I felt like I was still gaining weight instead of losing it. 
Doctor: Did you follow it exactly as you are, as you were asked to do?
Patient: I tried my best. But I feel like I am not doing it correctly or something. 
Doctor: Okay, tell me what kind of activities are you doing? How much physical activity are you doing on a regular basis? 
Patient: I try to walk around one and a half to two miles like every other day, but I'm spending more time in my garden and doing the yard work by myself. 
Doctor: That's good. Gardening gets-- can get hard and it helps you keep active. 
Patient: Oh yes, picking up all those pots from here to there and knowing that backyard of mine, it's a hard job. 
Doctor: Tell me what brings you here today? Like how can I help you? 
Patient: So, I think the meal plan that you gave was not working for me and there was definitely some weight gain, so I went back to my old South Beach Diet. 
Doctor: Okay. What were the results with your South Beach Diet then? Was it effective? 
Patient: I was able to get some pounds off. I felt pretty good about it. 
Doctor: That's good. Then what's the issue? 
Patient: Well, you see, deep in my heart I know this South Beach Diet is not a healthy diet for me and that's why I'm back to you. 
Doctor: I appreciate your honesty. You don't know how happy you made me by saying that. 
Patient: Yeah. You know, I'm here. So, tell me what to do to lose all this extra weight and how to enforce a low fat diet? What are your recommendations for that? 
Doctor: Let's set a plan for you.","This is a followup dietary consultation for hyperlipidemia, hypertension, and possible metabolic syndrome.  The patient reports that she has worked hard for a number of weeks following the meal plan prescribed, but felt like she was gaining weight and not losing weight on it.  She is not sure that she was following it accurately.  She is trying to walk 1-1/2 to 2 miles every other day, but is increasing her time in the garden and doing other yard work as well.  Once she started experiencing some weight gain, she went back to her old South Beach Diet and felt like she was able to take some of that weight off.  However she realizes that the South Beach Diet is not a healthy diet for her and so is coming back for better instruction on safe weight loss and low-fat eating.","Given the two context, please generate a summarization for the dialogue:

Doctor: Tell me what happened in detail.
Guest_family: She has a history of seizures. She used to have shakes and lose consciousness. 
Doctor: Was she taking any medications for that? 
Guest_family: Yeah, she was placed on Keppra solution one hundred and fifty M G for two times a day. It helped a lot and she was doing fine. Her seizures were improving a lot but recently we have noticed something similar again. 
Doctor: What kind of symptoms are showing now? 
Guest_family: She will just stop doing everything and stare blankly. We tried to shake her but during that period she just does not respond.
Doctor: Does she becomes floppy like can't control her body during that phase? 
Guest_family: No, we didn't notice that. 
Doctor: How long is that period? 
Guest_family2: I think it lasts somewhere around ten to fifteen seconds. 
Doctor: What are your thoughts on this? As a mother you might be spending more time with her. 
Guest_family: Yeah, I have noticed this too, but I think it stays for like three to four minutes. 
Doctor: So, it is somewhere around thirty to forty seconds.
Guest_family: One day I was outside the store and then I noticed that she had a similar event. Her skin around her mouth turned blue. 
Doctor: Was she having any kind of jerky motions?
Guest_family: No. 
Doctor: Have you changed her medications like the amount you are giving or anything like that? 
Guest_family: No, we haven't changed anything. She's still on the same dose. 
Doctor: I'm looking at the record and it says that she is supposed to take twenty M G per kilogram every day. It looks like a very low dose for her.","The patient is a 2-1/2-year-old female with a history of known febrile seizures, who was placed on Keppra oral solution at 150 mg b.i.d. to help prevent febrile seizures.  Although this has been a very successful treatment in terms of her febrile seizure control, she is now having occasional brief periods of pauses and staring, where she becomes unresponsive, but does not lose her postural tone.  The typical spell according to dad last anywhere from 10 to 15 seconds, mom says 3 to 4 minutes, which likely means probably somewhere in the 30- to 40-second period of time.

Doctor: Hello nurse, who do we have here today?
Guest_clinician: This is a thirty-seven-year-old, left-handed male. He visited us one month ago for headaches, nausea, and vomiting. His exams from that time showed no evidence of bowel obstruction and he was released home.
Doctor: Was there any improvement after your discharge, sir?
Patient: No, I had the same symptoms on and off after that. 
Doctor: What problems are you facing now?
Patient: I am seeing things blurred and having difficulty concentrating. My headaches are worse when sitting up. I notice them first thing in the morning. 
Doctor: How would you describe your headaches? 
Patient: They're dull, constant, and it feels like as if my head is wrapped in a tight band. 
Doctor: Your headache starts from which part of your head? 
Patient: It normally starts on the forehead and then it kind of goes to the back. It happens like six times a day. Lying down or putting my head down between my knees helps.
Doctor: What else do you feel along with your headaches? 
Patient: Like I told the Nurse here before, I get blurry eyesight, nausea and there is vomiting. Any kind of bright light hurts. I'm just afraid of loud sounds. 
Guest_clinician: I discussed with him about any blind spots, positive visual phenomena, weakness, numbness, tingling or double vision or any speech disorder, but he denies everything.
Doctor: How about your weight? 
Patient: It has been going up and down like for over past three months. I was one hundred and sixty three and then I know it was one hundred and forty eight at a point. 
Guest_clinician: Today his weight is one hundred and fifty four pounds.
Doctor: How are you eating habits in the last, let's say, one month? 
Patient: It has been bad. I don't feel like eating anymore. Looks like I have lost my appetite.","This 37y/o LHM was seen one month prior to this presentation for HA, nausea and vomiting. Gastrointestinal evaluation at that time showed no evidence of bowel obstruction and he was released home. These symptoms had been recurrent since onset. At presentation he complained of mild blurred vision (OU), difficulty concentrating and HA which worsened upon sitting up. The headaches were especially noticeable in the early morning. He described them as non-throbbing headaches. They begin in the bifrontal region and radiate posteriorly. They occurred up to 6 times/day. The HA improved with lying down or dropping the head down between the knees towards the floor. The headaches were associated with blurred vision, nausea,vomiting, photophobia, and phonophobia. He denied any scotomata or positive visual phenomena. He denies any weakness, numbness, tingling, dysarthria or diplopia. His weight has fluctuated from 163# to 148# over the past 3 months and at present he weighs 154#.
